# Task-Manager
Through the use of abstraction, subroutines were created to perform specific functions within a large program.
Robust code was created to allow a user to choose options from a menu, register unique user names, log in, assign tasks to themselves, view their own tasks, and generate reports.
These elements were loaded to, and saved to, text files.
